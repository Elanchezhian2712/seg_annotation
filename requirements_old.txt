# requirements.txt
# For a unified installation of top segmentation libraries (2025)
#
# --- INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ---
# 1. Install PyTorch MANUALLY first using the command from the official website:
#    https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
#
# 2. After PyTorch is installed, run:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Note: The Detectron2 installation will compile C++/CUDA code, which may
#       take several minutes and requires a C++ compiler (like g++ or MSVC).
# ===================================================================

# --- Core Segmentation Libraries ---

# 1. MMSegmentation and its core dependencies
# This will automatically pull in mmengine and mmcv
mmsegmentation>=1.0.0

# 2. Detectron2 (installed from its official repository)
# This method ensures it compiles correctly for your system's PyTorch/CUDA versions.
#git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git

# 3. Segmentation Models PyTorch (SMP)
segmentation-models-pytorch

# 4. Ultralytics (for using Segment Anything Model - SAM)
ultralytics

# --- Common Dependencies & Utilities ---
# These are often required by the libraries above but are listed for clarity.
